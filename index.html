                            When choosing band members, there are a myriad of considerations
                            to take into account. You have to think about their abilities, musical
                            talent, schedules, how frequently they play, and their general
                            preferences. Thinking about how all these pieces fit together can be
                            quite daunting, so a good planning tool is a necessity for this process.
                            One great tool is <a href="https://www.planningcenter.com/services">Planning Center Online Services</a>, which 
                            has extensive functionality for keeping track of musicians and all their
                            attributes and has helpful tools to visualize what musicians are available.

                            Choosing the setlist for a worship set is an artform. The songs should be new
                            but familiar, interesting but easy, and contain lyrics that are simple and easy to
                            sing, but still carry a meaninful message. A set should have a common thread
                            or theme in its lyrics and also flow musically - either low, dynamically, to high,
                            or high to low, or some combination of the two. Point being, it should have an
                            intentional dynamic flow and feel natural. A final consideration is whether or
                            not the musicians you picked in step 1 are competent enough to play the songs and 
                            will enjoy playing them. Perhaps you'll need to revisit step 1 if there is a 
                            particular song you'd like to do but your musicians can't handle it. To this end, 
                            it is important not to contact musicians until the songs have been chosen. <br><br>

                            The most important things to have ready for the first rehearsal are 
                            musical notation for the musicians (chord charts, lyrics, etc.) and 
                            a confident plan for the flow of each song (flow being the order of choruses,
                            verses, bridges, etc.). This can change slightly in the rehearsal, but it
                            is essential to at least have a plan confident enough to convey to the musicians 
                            in order to get a song going and the creative juices flowing. Once these pieces 
                            are taken care of, there are extra steps which can be taken such as writing 
                            additional parts, adding runs or licks to the songs, and creating click tracks.
