        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Leading a worship band has many more moving pieces and components than
            people may realize. The leader has to match a myriad of musicians together
            into one band, taking into account their preferences, musical talent and
            abilities, schedules, how frequently they’ve played, etc. Then the leader
            has to pick songs that flow nicely together both in the way they sound and
            in the message their lyrics convey. Plus, it is best to pick songs that the
            band enjoys to play. Once the songs and people are chosen, the leader has
            to find rehearsal times that match everyone’s
            schedules, reserve a venue to practice in, and find chord charts for the songs.
            This of course can only be done once the leader knows what keys the singers want
            the songs in. Then the leader has to arrange each song and decide in what order
            they want to do the different pieces of the song, taking in to account the way other
            people usually do the song. Then there comes the matter of managing a rehearsal.
            The leader has to easily convey to his or her band what they want the songs to
            sound like.

                Click tracks
            </a>
            are a great tool for this, but these take a long time to
            make, and a great deal of expertise. Click tracks are audio tracks that have both
            a metronome and verbal cues that tell the band which piece of the song comes next.
            Finally, the leader needs to think about communicating their audio needs to a tech
            team and the lyrics of their songs to the projectionist, and make sure the lyrics
            are in the perfect order. <br>

            There are a myriad of steps that worship leaders have to think about when
            designing a worship set, and for many the sheer number of steps is daunting.
            I think it would be great to have a webpage that walks people step-by-step through
            the process of designing a worship set and has all the necessary tools in one place.
            Worship leaders typically use countless online tools to accomplish their needs.
            There are resources for chord charts, song lists, beats per minute for each song,
            click track creation tutorials, etc. It would be great to have all these tools in
            one place that are presented at the appropriate steps in the whole process. A worship
            leader could come to this website and simply walk through every step in the process
            and have a complete, well polished worship set by the end of it.

        <h2>Possible App Integrations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Song bpm lookup
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In this app the user could enter the name of literally any song and
                        the bpm for popular recordings of it would be returned.
                        See <a href="https://songbpm.com/">songbpm.com</a> for an idea of what
                        this would look like. This is great for creating click tracks for songs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Youtube Integration
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There could be direct youtube playlists embedded in the webpage
                        that would show the user how to do various technical tasks in creating
                        a worship set, like how to create click tracks, how to use
                        <a href="https://www.planningcenter.com/">planning center</a>,
                        how to see everyone’s schedules in Outlook calendar, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Song Key lookup
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This would be a database of worship songs with suggested keys.
                        The user could enter a song title and possible keys would be returned,
                        like the best key for a guy to sing the song in and the best key for a
                        girl to sing the song in, etc. This is super helpful because then the
                        worship leader can get a jump on song planning without having to wait
                        around for the singers to get back to them.
